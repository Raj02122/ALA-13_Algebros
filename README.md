Abstract:
The flow of traffic is a necessary component
of our daily lives. There is not enough
capacity on the road to handle all the cars at
the same moment, resulting in road
congestion. The major objective of our
project is on how the orientation of traffic
signals and other traffic control devices with
the amount of traffic in a gateway can
immensely support to aid traffic congestion
or, in some cases, greatly reduce the flow of
traffic. The following analysis of traffic flow
over a road network during peak hours
shows how a linear equation system and its
answer works.
